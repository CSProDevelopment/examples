Example Labor Force Survey 
========================== 

This is an example labor force survey designed for CAPI data collection on 
mobile devices. 

There are two CSPro applications used in this survey: 

* PopstanLFS: the survey questionnaire application 
* Menu: a menu program for interviewers and field supervisors to manage the 
survey process 

Workflow 
-------- 
The Popstan Labor Force Survey workflow is based on a few assumptions: 

- CSEntry has been installed on all mobile devices 
- The Popstan Labor Force Survey project has been deployed to all devices 
- Supervisors will have access to the Internet, but interviewers will not 

Synchronizations between the supervisor and headquarters will occur over the 
Internet. However, synchronizations between the supervisor and interviewer will 
occur over the Bluetooth protocol. 

Preparing the staff and sample files 
------------------------------------ 

All supervisors and interviewers are assigned a code and a role (interviewer or 
supervisor). The lookup data file Staff.csdb contains the code, name and role 
of each staff member. 

All households to be interviewed must first be added to the Sample.csdb lookup 
file. Interviewers will choose from the sample households when starting an 
interview. The sample file also contains the assignments of households to 
interviewers and supervisors. 

To update the staff and sample files, edit the corresponding Excel spreadsheet 
(Staff.xlsx or Sample.xlsx) and then use the CSPro2Excel tool to convert the 
spreadsheet to a CSPro data file. CSPro2Excel scripts (CreateStaffFromExcel and 
CreateSampleFromExcel) are provided for this purpose. 

The initial versions of the staff and sample files will be deployed with the 
application itself. Once interviewers are in the field, these files will be 
updated using data synchronization. Upload the updated staff and sample files 
to Dropbox using the DataViewer tool and the next time the supervisor 
synchronizes with headquarters they will download it. When the supervisor then 
synchronizes with the interviewer over Bluetooth the files will be updated on 
the interviewers device. 

Deploying the applications 
-------------------------- 

To deploy the applications to a mobile device, run the deployment script 
DeployPopstanLFS.csds. This will generate a folder named DeployLaborForceSurvey 
containing all the required files. Simply copy this folder to the CSEntry 
folder of the mobile device. 

Running the applications 
------------------------ 

Interviewers and supervisors must first login to the application using the 
staff code from the staff file. This automatically loads their assignments from 
the sample file. The interviewer then selects the households to interview from 
the households that they have been assigned. 

Once the interviewers have collected data for several households they will 
synchronize with the supervisor. All newly collected household data will be 
sent to the supervisor. 

Having synchronized with each interviewer the supervisor will travel to an area 
where they have access to the Internet. The supervisor then synchronizes with 
headquarters sending all data from the interviewers to the central server. For 
this application, Dropbox will be our central server but it can be changed to 
another server by modifying the syncconnect(Dropbox) call in the menu program. 

Use DataViewer to download the combined data file from the server that contains 
the data sent from all the supervisors. 



Editing the application
-----------------------

The variable names are very short so it may be helpful to use the "append 
labels to names in tree" option in the view menu to see the more descriptive 
labels. 

The questionnaire was designed to be modular. To make it easier to skip 
modules, "dummy" variables have been added to the dictionary and forms to mark 
the start and end of each module. For example, the employment module has the 
variables EMPSTART and EMPEND. These variables are all protected so the 
interviewer never sees them. They are used as targets for skip commands. To 
disable a module, you can can simply logic to the preproc of the start module 
variable to skip to the end module variable. This design makes it easier to 
disable modules if they are not needed for a particular population.
