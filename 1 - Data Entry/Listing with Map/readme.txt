Example Listing Application With Maps
==========================================

This is an example of using maps in the case listing of a data entry
application. 

The application is used to collect the location and basic information
about structures (buildings). The structures that have been surveyed
are displayed on map. Tapping on the structure on the map allows you
to view and edit information about the structure.

For a more complex example that displays households on a map using the
map object in logic see the Listing Menu Application With Maps example.
Using the map object in a menu program allows customization of the map
but requires writing complex logic.

Requirements
------------

Since the mapping functionality only works on Android, this application
can only be run on Android devices. 

The Android device must have Google Play Services installed. If the 
Google Play Services on the device is an older version you may need to 
upgrade to the latest version through the Google Play application.

This application uses online maps so a network connection is required.
