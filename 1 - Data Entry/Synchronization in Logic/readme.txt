Synchronization in Logic

Purpose:        To perform synchronization of data and program files with a web server and between
                interviewer and supervisor devices using Bluetooth. For many cases, synchronization can
                be done more easily by setting the synchronization options without writing any logic. This
                application demonstrates synchronization from a menu program which is needed when using Bluetooth
                or when synchronizing multiple applications/dictionaries at once.

Program:        Provides a menu program that launches a simple data entry application and provides options
                to synchronize with a web server or between tablets using Bluetooth.

Keywords used:  syncconnect, syncdata, syncfile, syncdisconnect, syncserver, execpff, getos, setcaselabel

Files:          Menu/Menu.ent: menu program that launches household questionnaire program and performs synchronization
                Household/HouseholdQuestionnaire.ent: household questionnaire data entry program
                Dict/Household/HouseholdQuestionnaire.dcf: household questionnaire dictionary shared by both applications
                Data/HouseholdQuestionnaire.csdat: data file for household questionnaire
                Deployment: folder created by the CSPro Deploy Application Tool to copy to Android device/server


How to use:
    . Open Menu.ent data entry application
    . Modify the server URL, username, and password in the function syncWithHeadquarters() to match your server and save the file
    . Double click on the file Deploy Synchronization in Logic.csds to open the deployment spec
	. Click deploy to deploy the application to the local folder Deployment
    . Copy the folder Deployment to the files folder of the CSWeb server
    . Upload the dictionary Household/HouseholdQuestionnaire.dcf to your CSWeb server
    . If running on Android, copy the folder Deployment to the csentry folder on the Android device
    . Run the menu application, login as interviewer, choose "enter data" and enter some cases
    . Run the menu application, login as supervisor, choose "Sync with headquarters" to synchronize with the web server
    . Run the menu application, on two devices, login as supervisor on one device and choose "Sync with interviewer",
        login as interviewer on the other device and choose "Sync with supervisor"
