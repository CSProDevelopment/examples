PROC GLOBAL

{ This application demonstrates how to create a CSV file of selected variables using FileWrite commands.
  In this example, several variables related to Persons are output,
  preceded by some identification variables, and followed by some housing variables.
  Commas are used as delimiters in this example.  You could use semi-colons or whatever delimeter you wish.
  The CSV file can then be easily read by Excel or other software that uses delimited files. }
