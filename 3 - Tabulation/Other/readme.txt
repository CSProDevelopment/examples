CSPro tabulation program TableTipsNTricks.xtb illustrates a variety of techniques that you can use in the tabulation system:

Table 1. Age by Sex: Illustrates the use of overlapping ranges in value set to compute subtotals for age

Table 2. Divorced by Urban/Rural and Sex for Age > 15: Illustrates use of disjoint value ranges in value set for marital status

Table 3. Sex and Literacy by Urban/Rural for Age > 10: Illustrates using "Hide" of Male subgrouping by modifying value set for sex

Table 4. Sex and Literacy by Urban/Rural for Age > 10: Illustrates using "Hide" of subgrouping as in Table 3 but this time using multiple subtables with universes.

Table 5. Sex and Literacy by Urban/Rural for Age > 10: Illustrates Modify format of an item in one subgrouping without modifying corresponding items in other subgroupings.  Implemented using multiple subtables rather than true subgroupings.

Table 6. Marital status by Urban/Rural for Age > 15: Illustrates using single variable recode using value sets.  Recode from original 5 categories of marital status down to 2 categories.

Table 7. Complete plumbing by Urban/Rural: Illustrates using multiple variable recode using multiple subtables with universes.  Compute new recoded variable complete plumbing based on three existing variables (toilet, bathing, source of water).  Compare this approach to using tablogic (see tablogic examples).
